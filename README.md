ANTHONY O'RJOGER

Anthony is a personal friend of mine, who plays music arouns West London as a full time job. I decided to use Anthony as a website
subject so I had a personal connection to the project, and a vested interest. I wanted to keep the design as simple as possible with minimal
colour pallet, and clean styling. I wanted the site to be responsive with slightly different appearance across small and large devices. 

UX

I wanted to build a site that Anthony could use to promote himself for both private and public gigs. I wanted it to be simple for users to 
find the info on the site that they were looking for, and to easily be able to get in touch with Anthony if they wanted to book him, which 
is why I put two different contact forms in.
