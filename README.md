# ANTHONY O'RJOGER 

Anthony is a personal friend of mine, who plays music arouns West London as a full time job. I decided to use Anthony as a website
subject so I had a personal connection to the project, and a vested interest. I wanted to keep the design as simple as possible with minimal
colour pallet, and clean styling. I wanted the site to be responsive with slightly different appearance across small and large devices. 

# UX

I wanted to build a site that Anthony could use to promote himself for both private and public gigs. I wanted it to be simple for users to 
find the info on the site that they were looking for, and to easily be able to get in touch with Anthony if they wanted to book him, which 
is why I put two different contact forms in. 

I also wanted it to be easy for the users to find the content they were looking for, which is why it was split across pages, and not across
a large scrollable area.

# FEATURES

- The user accesses a dropdown menu by clicking on "Content" within the nav bar
- The user is linked to the "quick contact" at the bottom of the screen when they click on "Contact" within the nav bar. If the user
  wishes to give some extra information on the gig, they can click the large "Click here to make a full enquiry" button. On mobile
  this button dissapears and the full enquiry form is loaded at the bottom of each page.
- The user can open all of Anthony's social links from the footer which will open in a new tab.
- The user accesses a photo modal when clicking on each of the photos
- When the user clicks on any of the "Get in touch" buttons, a modal will open. 
- When displaying on mobile screens, the information on the front page will turn into scrollable text boxes. This was to free up space
  on the front screen without losing any of the information, and so the page didn't appear so information heavy. 
- When viewed on a mobile device the nav bar hides the image of Anthony, along with his name and the tag line. This is replaced with Anthony's 
  logo and the nav bar below the logo.
 

## FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT

- I'd like to incorporate an interactive calendar to show where Anthony was playing on upcoming dates
- A social feed to show latest updates on the front page would be a nice addition as well.
- I was unable to work out how to create a modal for the contact forms, that would display if the required info wasn't entered into the form.
  In this case I would want at the very least a name and email.


# TECHNOLOGIES USED

- [HTML](https://html.com/) - Content is written in HTML 
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) - Styling is achieved through a linked CSS style document
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Modals and dropdown menu's were achieved through Javascript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap was used as a framework 
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - I used fontawesome for some small images used on the front page
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - The two main font's I used were sourced from Google fonts

# TESTING

I ran my code through a code validator (https://validator.w3.org/nu/) which returned a number of errors which I fixed easily. 
I also used the "audit" feature on the developer tools in Google Chrome, and then worked on getting the scores on all my pages as high as possible. 
Anything remaining, I simply couldn't work out how to fix and will do some research into those errors. I also used the developer tools "responsive"
feature to make sure the page continued to look and respond how I wanted in all view sizes. 

1. Contact form
  - Click on "Contact" in the nav bar. You should be taken to the bottom of the page to the "quick contact" section
  - Click the button "click here to make a full enquiry". You should be rediredcted to another contact page.
  - Fill in the appropriate name, email and description fields, and click "get in touch". 
  - A modal should open to say "I'll be in touch shortly"

2. Photo modals
  - Click on the "Content" button in the nav bar
  - Select "photos"
  - In the photos page, click on the images. A photo modal should open up. 
  - There should be a description at the bottom of the modal. 
  - Click the "Close" button when you are done.


### Responsive styling 

The nav bar and header are styled differently for desktop and mobile. On mobile the nav bar is smaller and placed under the header, not to the side. 
The image is below the nav bar to create a gap between the nav bar and the content. Anthony's name and tag line also dissapears and his logo takes
over the headder. On desktop the the image is placed to the left of the header and nav bar and Anthony's name is shown within the header. 

On the main landing page the content will fall into scrollable text boxes at mobile view. This is to cut down the amount of viewable information on the
landing page on mobile. 

On mobile view the "quick contact" page at the bottom dissapears and the full contact page takes over. The "Click here to make a full enquiry" button
also dissapears. 

In mobile view the photos on the "photos" page are displayed on top of each other, where as on desktop they are side by side. 

# Deployment

I have deployed my site on GitHub 

[My final site can be found here](https://simongeorgenz.github.io/milestone_1/)

# Credits

The calculation for the responsive text used on .name and .tag-line was found at 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15649244/responsive-font-size-in-css 

Code for the modals used in my project were found at 

https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/modals/basic/

and

https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_modal.asp

Instructional videos from “Putting It All Together | Mini Project with Bootstrap 4” were used extensively while completing this project.

I used bootstrap extensively throughout this project, and relied heavily on the instruction given on Bootstraps website.

I also used W3 schools tutorials when bootstrap couldn't give me what I was looking for. 

# Media 

All images, videos and information was found at Anthony's current site

# Acknowledgements

I used inspiration for this project from Slack after reading through other students comments about their Milestone 1 Project. 

# Anti Plagiarism

To the best of my knowledge I have credited all sources of media and code that is not my own. Anything missed is absolutely an error on my part, 
and is unintentional, and is in no way me trying to be villainous.
